# DUCOFirmware

This is the Arduino Uno folder that needed to be burnt in

## How to use it

- Download or clone this folder to your local. Make sure you get rid of the surfix "-master" generated by Github, since Arduino requires the folder name should match the main file name.
- connect your device to laptop, find the correct Serial Port on Arduino IDE "tools" sidebar. Then upload this Firmware into your device. At last make sure Arduino IDE is **NOT** occupying the Port after uploading, otherwise GUI Serial Port connection on Processing will fail.

## Functionality we provide
