# DUCOGUI

This is the GUI folder for DUCO, it's based on Processing.

## How to use it

- Download or clone this folder to your local. Make sure you get rid of the surfix "-master" generated by Github, since Processing requires the folder name should match the main file name.
- If you have nothing to develop or tune, directly click on run. Then the interface will pop-up.

## Introduction to the Interface

- please refer to Section 6 of the paper

## Note

- photo paper/wood is a bit hard to fabricate circuits, so we enable Microstep. However, it's a super slow process without any speed control.
- Welcome page has a **Pen Position** menu. That part of functionality is not in use right now. It was aimed at making different mounting slots distinguishable by DUCO. However it requires different reflective stickers and responding different threshold set in Firmware. If you are interested in making it work, contact us!
